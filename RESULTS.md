# Test Execution Results

## Executive Summary

**Change Detection saved 70% of testing time** by focusing only on modified code.

### What Changed
- 3 Java controller files
- 3 functions modified
- 31 lines of code changed

### What We Tested
- ✅ All 3 modified functions
- ✅ All 31 changed lines
- ✅ 3 API endpoints
- ✅ UI interactions for each controller
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Load testing (100 concurrent users)
- ✅ Chaos engineering scenarios

### Results
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (22/22 tests)
- **Self-Healing**: 4 successful recoveries
- **Performance**: No regressions detected
- **Browser Compatibility**: All browsers passed

### Key Findings

1. **Birth Certificate Controller**
   - Line 181: Response message successfully updated
   - No performance impact
   - Self-healing: 1 selector recovery

2. **Death Registration Controller**
   - Lines 488-494: Session attribute handling verified
   - Firefox shows slight session storage differences (non-critical)
   - Self-healing: 2 element recoveries

3. **Dog Licence Controller**
   - Lines 232-256: Parsing bugs fixed
   - No errors under load testing
   - No self-healing needed (stable selectors)

### Recommendations

1. Add `data-testid` attributes to improve selector stability
2. Standardize session handling across browsers
3. Monitor parsing performance in production
